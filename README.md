# Hashmap-StateCapitals

This project serves as a basic example of using HashMap and TreeMap in Java to manage and display data. It also demonstrates handling user input and providing responses based on the input.

The State Capitals Map project is a simple Java application that manages and displays the capitals of U.S. states. The project uses a HashMap to store the states and their capitals, and a TreeMap to sort and display them alphabetically. The application also allows the user to search for the capital of a specific state.
